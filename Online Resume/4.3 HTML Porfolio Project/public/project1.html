<h1>The Best Movies According to Pri</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter Film Series</h3>
<p>Every Harry Potter movie is my comfort movie. I really
    like the story and plot and characters. Since, I've read all the
    HP books, I've been such a fan aka potterhead.
    Oh how I wish I was a witch!
</p>
<h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
<p>Tbh this Hindi film is such a great film. It's pretty emotional and funny.But
    teaches quite a lot of lessons. Watched it so many times. And cried!
</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>It is such a heart-warming movie. This movie is soo important and everyone should watch this
   atleast once in their lifetime. I love the movie and it's one of my all time favorites.
